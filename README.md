---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\For my Object Oriented Programming(OOP) assignment we had to write a program for		    /
\a HUD.The theme of the project was Sci Fi and I decided to create a dashboard				/
\for a spaceship.The dashboard of the space ship has a number of user interactive			/
\features such as acceleration,deceleration,playing of music, entering into a				/
\hyper jump etc.																			/
\To make the Project I used proceduraly generated graphics,classes,polymorphism,			/
\loops,methods,switch statements, some trigonometry and more.I also							/
\went beyond the study we had done and added sound into the HUD.							/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Features:
----------------------
*All graphics are generated by the program using arcs,lines,shapes,ellipses,points etc.
*Use of classes and polymorphism
*The program plays music when a button is pressed
*The program has a screen with two sound waves which
 react when the music is played.
*Use of ,translation,rotation,push matrix and pop matrix
*Interaction between user and HUD.


Part 1(Loadin Screen):
----------------------
Part one of my OOP Assignemnt is the loading screen.
The assignment begins with a screen that asks the user to hold the button 'E'.
As the user presses down on the button E an animation of a circular loading bar 
begins to loop into a circle. If the button is release before the circle is complete
the loading process reverses and the size of the arc that creates the animation begins
decreasing until the loading progress reaches 0%.
If the loading circle is complete a variable is set to true and signals the program that 
the loading process is complete.
From there the transition between the loading screen and the actuall HUD begins.

Part 2(Transition):
----------------------
The transition creats a fade effect.When the program is signaled that the loading 
has completed the background color begins slowly changing into black.When the whole 
screen is black then a message notifying the user that all systems of the 'ship' are
now operational(sticking to the sci fi theme of the project).When the message is display 
another variable is set to 1 to tell the game that now the animation of the loading screen has 
been completed and therefore the program should now proceed to displaying the actuall HUD(The game 
state is now equal to 1).
For displaying the ship I follow a similar slow fade transition that slowly fills in the
color to all the spaceship components which creates an effect as if the user has just
went into the ship and has now turned on all the light in the ship.


Part3(HUD):
----------------------
Once the HUD has been generated then the user can begin interatcting with it.
If the user presses the 'W' key the ship begins to gain speed and the fuel bar, 
speed meter and the RPM meter begin moving.As the ship gains speed,the speed bar
begins to light up and creates like a loading animation. When it gets to the end
then it has reached maxed speed.Also above the speed bar the speed is displayed.
The Fuel meter begins dropping levels as the speed increases. If the fuel meter hits zero
a warning message is displayed and the ship speed begins to drop as it has ran out of fuel.
If the user releases the accelerationg key then the fuel meter quickly fills up again 
and the user can keep accelerating the speed.
The RPM meter works almost like a speed meter,but it shows the user how hard the engine is
working.Since the RPM meter is an arc, as the arc increases to a certain level the ship 
switches gears and the RPM drops for a bit. If the user stops the movement of the ship, the RPM
levels drop, and as the arc decreeses and reaches a certain level, then the ship switches to a 
lower gear and the RPM increases. The RPM meter works just like the one in a car, and its purpose
is to show the user how much harder the engine of the ship works as the speed increases.
By far my most favourite part of the project is the 'Hyper Jump' button on the top left.
When the user presses this button ,the lights in the ship go off ,except for the outlines of the
ship's dashboard,they begin flashing. The scene change almost into a rave and then the music 
comes on.The main feture of this is not really the music, but the screen that appears in the
top dashboard of the ship. It consists of two sound lines , that bounce up and down to the
beat of the music.
The radar is in the bottom right of the ship. It is constantly rotating and scanning the 
ships surroundings for incoming missiles.


Things I didnt get to finish :(
--------------------------------
I would have like to add a bit more limitation to the speed of the ship when the RPMs
of the ship went to the max.
